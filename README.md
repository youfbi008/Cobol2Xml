Cobol2Xml
================

Cobol2Xml is a parser which can convert cobol files to xml files.  

You can use the JAR file(Cobol2Xml.jar) like the next line.
java -cp Cobol2Xml.jar koopa.app.cli.ToXml <cobol-file> <xml-file>

To fit the rule of "Code2xml", It will be improved little by little.

# How to build

Use ant to run build.xml.
Then the JAR file will be created.
